Heat rises from the motor in a realistic manner, and the timing of all events matches physical expectations: the motor activates, the fan starts turning, and heat emission is continuous and proportional.

      "Description2": "Goblets start vibrating or breaking even when the driving frequency is far from their labeled natural frequencies, or all goblets vibrate simultaneously regardless of the frequency. The speaker causes visible effects before any plausible frequency match. Wave patterns appear arbitrary or are not synchronized with the goblets' responses.",
      "Description3": "The middle goblet vibrates as expected at f\u2082, but one or both of the other goblets also show visible motion or mild vibration despite the frequency not matching their natural frequencies. The middle goblet might start vibrating slightly before or after the correct frequency. Wave patterns only partially correspond to the frequency matching.",
      "Description4": "The middle goblet begins to vibrate at f\u2082 as expected, but there is a slight lag in response or the vibration is visually awkward (e.g., amplitude grows too quickly or not smoothly). Perhaps one of the other goblets shows a tiny, brief motion that quickly dies out. Wave patterns are mostly correct but could have minor synchronization issues.",
      "Description5": "Only the middle goblet vibrates, and only when the speaker's frequency matches f\u2082. The goblet's motion builds up gradually and naturally, showing possible cracking or distortion. The other goblets remain still throughout. Animated wave patterns precisely align with the moment of resonance, visually reinforcing the teaching point without any distracting or inaccurate effects."
