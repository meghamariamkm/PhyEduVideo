Then, demonstrate the child being pushed at regular intervals matching the swing’s natural back-and-forth motion. With each well-timed push, the swing’s amplitude increases noticeably. Clearly highlight that the energy transfer is most efficient when the pushing frequency matches the swing’s natural frequency."

        "prompt": "Show three identical glass goblets placed side by side, each labeled with a different natural frequency (f₁, f₂, f₃). A nearby speaker emits a sound that gradually sweeps across frequencies. When the sound matches f₂, the middle goblet begins to visibly vibrate, possibly showing cracking or distortion. The other goblets remain unaffected. Use animated wave patterns to visually represent the matching frequencies."
